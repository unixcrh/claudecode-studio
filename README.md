## What is this?

Claude Code CLI is Anthropic's AI that writes code, runs commands, edits files, and ships features — not just talks about them. It's genuinely powerful.

The problem: it lives in your terminal. And the terminal has limits.

**Context gets lost.** Switch projects, and you lose your place. Come back tomorrow and you're scrolling through history to remember where you were.

**Parallel work is painful.** Want Claude working on three things at once? That means three terminal tabs, three sessions, three things to manage manually.

**No visibility.** Queue five tasks and walk away. Two hours later — which ones finished? Which ones failed? You're reading scrollback to find out.

**Screenshots and files are clunky.** "Look at this error" means uploading an image somewhere, getting a URL, pasting it. It works, but it's friction.

Claude Code Studio is the missing interface. You open it in your browser, and your AI starts working.

## Terminal vs Web UI

![Workflow comparison](public/screenshots/workflow-comparison.png)

The difference isn't just visual. A web interface changes how you think about delegating work to AI — from one-off prompts to a queue of managed tasks.

---

## What it actually does

### 💬 Chat that does things

Not a chatbot. When you type "refactor this function and add tests", Claude opens files, edits them, runs the tests, fixes errors, and reports back — in real time, right in the chat. Paste a screenshot with Ctrl+V and Claude sees it.

When Claude asks you a question mid-task, the card collapses into a sleek inline pill after you answer — keeping your chat clean and focused on what matters.

### 📋 Kanban board for your AI tasks

Create a card. Describe what you want. Move it to "To Do". Claude picks it up automatically and starts working.

![Kanban workflow](public/screenshots/kanban-diagram.png)

Queue 10 tasks, walk away, come back to all of them done. Cards can run **in parallel** (independent tasks) or **sequentially** (linked sessions, so Claude remembers what the previous task built).

**True parallel execution** — independent tasks now run simultaneously even in the same project directory. No artificial workdir locks holding them back. Chain tasks still respect sequential order, but standalone cards run at full speed, in parallel, the way you'd expect.

![Kanban screenshot](public/screenshots/03-kanban.png)

### 🕐 Scheduler — Your AI on Autopilot

What if Claude could work while you sleep?

Scheduler turns Claude Code Studio into a **self-running automation platform**. Create a task, set a time — Claude picks it up exactly when you need it. No cron jobs, no scripts, no babysitting.

**One-time tasks** — "Deploy to staging tomorrow at 6am before the team wakes up." Create the task, set the date, go home. Claude handles it at 6:00 sharp.

**Recurring tasks** — "Run a full security audit every Monday morning." Set recurrence to **weekly** and walk away. Claude runs the same task every week, creates a fresh session each time, and sends you a Telegram notification when it's done.

Four recurrence intervals: **hourly**, **daily**, **weekly**, **monthly**. Optional end date — the series stops automatically when you don't need it anymore.

**Examples:** Nightly test runs. Weekly dependency audits. Hourly server health checks. Monday morning code reviews that scan the week's commits. Daily standup reports from git activity. Not a dumb shell script — an AI that understands context, adapts to what it finds, and reports back with analysis. If you can describe it in a prompt, you can schedule it.

**How it works:**

1. Open the **Schedule** tab — you'll see an agenda timeline with color-coded sections: overdue (red), today (orange), upcoming (blue), recurring (purple)
2. Click **Add Task**, pick a date/time, choose recurrence if needed
3. Claude picks up the task when the time comes — up to **5 tasks run in parallel**
4. When a recurring task finishes, the next occurrence is created automatically
5. Server restarts? No problem — scheduled tasks survive in SQLite, and missed times are skipped gracefully (no accidental replay)

The **"Run Now"** button lets you override the schedule and execute any task immediately — useful for testing your setup before leaving it on autopilot.

### ⚡ Slash commands — your personal shortcuts

Type `/` in the chat input and a menu appears with your saved prompts. Pick one, hit Enter.

Instead of typing "Do a thorough code review: readability, performance, security, and adherence to best practices. Point out issues with severity levels" every time — you just type `/review`.

**8 commands ready out of the box:**

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/check` | Check syntax, logic, edge cases, and bugs step by step |
| `/review` | Full code review with severity levels (critical / warning / suggestion) |
| `/fix` | Find the bug, fix it, explain what changed |
| `/explain` | Explain the code clearly with examples |
| `/refactor` | Clean up the code, keep the same behavior |
| `/test` | Write tests: happy path, edge cases, error scenarios |
| `/docs` | Write documentation with examples and gotchas |
| `/optimize` | Find bottlenecks, propose improvements, estimate gains |

Add your own, edit them, delete them. As many as you want.

### 📱 Telegram Bot — Control Claude from Your Phone

Your laptop is closed. You're at the gym, in a meeting, across the world. But your AI is still working. And now — so are you.

Pair your phone with Claude Code Studio in 30 seconds (6-character code from Settings), and your phone becomes a full remote control:

**Queue & Monitor**
- `/projects` — browse all your sessions
- `/chats` — pick up where you left off
- `/chat` — start a new session right now
- `/tasks` — see your Kanban board. Which tasks are running? Which are done?

**See Results Instantly**
- `/last` — show Claude's last action (code written, tests run, files changed)
- `/full` — get the complete output of the last task
- **Kanban task notifications** — your phone buzzes when each queued task finishes or fails, with the task name, status, and how long it took. No more checking the browser to see if it's done.

**Manage on the Go**
- `/files`, `/cat` — browse project files and peek at code without opening an editor
- `/diff` — see exactly what changed in the last commit
- `/log` — recent git history — who changed what, and when
- `/tunnel` — start or stop Remote Access right from your phone (also available as a button in the main menu)
- `/url` — get the current public URL
- `/new` — start a new task queue
- `/stop` — stop a running task

**Claude Asks — You Answer from Your Phone**
Claude sometimes needs your input mid-task: "Should I refactor this function or rewrite it?" With ask_user forwarding, these questions appear instantly in Telegram as inline buttons. Tap your choice, or type a free-text answer — Claude gets it immediately and keeps working. No need to open the browser. You stay in the loop without breaking your flow.

**Inline Stop — One Tap to Cancel**
Every progress message in Telegram has a built-in [🛑 Stop] button. See Claude going in the wrong direction? Tap it. No commands to type, no menus to navigate — the button is right there, on every "Processing..." update. Combined with [🏠 Menu], you always have full control at your fingertips.

**Send Messages, Get Answers Instantly**
Type a message to Claude directly from Telegram. You see a real-time typing indicator while Claude thinks, and the response streams back to both your phone AND your browser simultaneously. The conversation is unified — continue in Telegram, pick it up on your laptop five minutes later, everything is there. And it works both ways: messages sent from Telegram appear in the web UI in real-time too.

**Multi-Device Pairing**
Pair your phone, your tablet, your laptop — all at once. Control the same Claude Code Studio instance from anywhere. Each device gets push notifications when tasks finish, with inline buttons: [View Result] [Continue] [Menu].

**Why This Matters**

You queue 10 refactoring tasks at 9pm. Instead of staring at your laptop, you go to the gym. At 10:15pm, your phone buzzes: "Task 3 complete". You tap [View] and see the changes. You add a comment: "Next, add error handling for the network case." Claude gets it immediately and starts task 4. Two hours later, everything is done. You tap [View Final] and review the full output in Telegram before you even sit at your desk.

No laptop required. No constant monitoring. Just work, delegated.

### 👥 Agent Modes

Claude Code Studio offers three ways to organize work: one agent, a team in-chat, or a full task dispatch system.

**Single** — one agent, one task, one conversation. Default mode. Best for focused work, debugging, and interactive back-and-forth.

**Multi** — the orchestrator decomposes the task into 2–5 subtasks with specialized agents. All run in-chat with real-time streaming. Agents can depend on each other (via `depends_on`), so one task's output feeds into the next. You see a team card with a progress bar. If planning fails, it falls back to Single automatically. You can also send a Multi plan to the Kanban board with the 📋 Kanban button.

**Dispatch** — like Multi, but instead of running in-chat, the subtasks are sent directly to the **Kanban board** as individual task cards. Each gets its own Claude session. Key differences from Multi:
- Tasks run as persistent Kanban cards (survive server restarts)
- Full dependency graph with `depends_on` — tasks start when their dependencies complete
- Auto-retry on failure (with exponential backoff)
- Cascade cancellation — if a dependency fails, all downstream tasks are cancelled
- Doesn't block the chat — you can keep chatting while tasks execute in the background
- Workdir lock — prevents two tasks from editing the same directory simultaneously

Comparison:

| | Single | Multi | Dispatch |
|---|---|---|---|
| Where it runs | Chat | Chat | Kanban board |
| Agents | 1 | 2–5, parallel | 2–5, as task cards |
| Dependencies | — | Basic (`depends_on`) | Full graph with `depends_on` |
| Auto-retry | No | No | Yes (with backoff) |
| Survives restart | No | No | Yes (SQLite-persisted) |
| Best for | Focused work | Complex tasks you want to watch | Background batch work |

**How to switch:** Click Single / Multi / Dispatch in the toolbar's "Agent" group.

### 🎛 Chat Modes

Three modes in the "Mode" toolbar group control what Claude is allowed to do:

**Auto** — the default. Claude has full access to all tools: reading files, writing code, running commands, editing. No guardrails — Claude decides what actions are needed.

**Plan** — read-only mode. Claude can explore the project, analyze code, and produce a plan, but **cannot modify files or run commands**. The tool list is restricted to read-only operations (View, Grep, Glob, ListDir). Use this when you want analysis and a plan of action before committing to changes — especially on unfamiliar codebases or risky refactorings.

When Claude produces a plan in Plan mode, an **"Execute Plan"** button appears at the bottom of the response. Click it — and Studio automatically switches to Auto mode and instructs Claude to execute the plan step by step. This creates a smooth workflow: analyze first, then execute with one click.

**Auto Plan Detection** — Studio now watches for plan completion signals in Claude's response. When Claude says "plan complete" or "starting execution", Studio automatically switches from Plan to Auto mode without you lifting a finger. You don't even need to click Execute Plan — the transition just happens.

**Task** — explicit execution mode. Same full tool access as Auto, with an added system instruction signaling this is an execution task. Practically similar to Auto but makes intent clear.

**How to switch:** Click Auto / Plan / Task in the toolbar's "Mode" group.

### 🧠 Skills & Auto-Skills

Skills are `.md` files that give Claude a specialist persona. When a skill is active, its full content is injected into the system prompt — like briefing an expert before they start work. Claude doesn't just "know about" the domain — it thinks from within it: applies the right patterns, avoids known anti-patterns, and stays within the skill's scope.

**28 skills bundled out of the box:** frontend, backend, api-designer, security, devops, docker, kubernetes, postgres, debugging, code-review, fullstack, UI/UX design, technical writing, and more.

**Auto-skills (⚡ Auto)** — enabled by default. When you send a message, Studio classifies your request with a fast Haiku call and activates 1–4 relevant skills automatically:

- "Fix this React rendering bug" → activates `frontend` + `debugging-master`
- "Set up Kubernetes deployment" → activates `devops` + `kubernetes` + `docker`
- "Review this API for security" → activates `security` + `api-designer` + `code-review`

Think of it as **hiring the right specialist for each job**. Instead of a generalist answering everything, Claude adopts the mindset, experience, and vocabulary of the relevant domain expert. A frontend question gets answered by someone who has debugged hydration mismatches at 3am, not by a generalist who read the React docs once.

You can also pick skills manually in the sidebar — this turns off Auto mode. Add your own `.md` files to the `skills/` directory for custom specializations.

### ⚙️ Model & Turns

**Model** — which Claude processes your request. Three options in the "Model" toolbar group:

| Model | Strengths | Best for |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Haiku** | Fastest, cheapest | Simple questions, formatting, quick checks |
| **Sonnet** | Balance of speed and depth (default) | Most everyday tasks |
| **Opus** | Most capable, deepest reasoning | Complex architecture, difficult bugs, nuanced analysis |

**Turns** — how many steps Claude can take before stopping (default: **50**, range: 1–200). One turn ≈ one action: read a file, write code, run a test. Complex tasks need more turns.

Rough guide:
- Simple question → 5–10 turns
- Bug fix → 15–30 turns
- Feature implementation → 50–100 turns
- Large refactoring → 100–200 turns

If Claude hits the turn limit mid-task, it **auto-continues up to 3 times** — so a 50-turn budget effectively allows up to 200 steps before it asks you to continue manually.

### 🌐 Remote servers over SSH

Add a remote server, create a project pointing to a directory on it, and Claude works there — as if local. Useful for GPU machines, staging environments, or managing a server fleet without SSH sessions.

### 🔗 Remote Access — Open Your Studio to the World

Your Studio runs on `localhost:3000`. But what if you need to access it from a coffee shop, your phone's browser, or share a link with a teammate?

One click. That's it. Open the **Remote Access** panel in the sidebar, pick a provider — **cloudflared** (no signup, works instantly) or **ngrok** (if you already use it) — and hit Start. You get a public HTTPS URL in seconds.

- **Zero configuration** — cloudflared needs no account, no token, no DNS setup
- **Secure by default** — your Studio password protects everything, the tunnel is just a pipe
- **Telegram integration** — the URL is sent straight to your paired Telegram devices with one tap
- **Start and stop from your phone** — `/tunnel` and `/url` commands in the Telegram bot
- **Works behind NAT, firewalls, corporate VPNs** — if your machine has internet, it works

Why does this matter? Because your AI doesn't need to be chained to your desk. Start a batch of tasks at home, grab the URL from Telegram, and check results from anywhere.

### 📱 Mobile-Ready — Use It from Your Phone's Browser

Not just Telegram. Open your Studio's public URL (via Remote Access) in any mobile browser — and the full UI works.

- **Touch-optimized** — 44px tap targets, scroll-snap Kanban columns, swipeable panels
- **iOS-safe** — no auto-zoom on focus, proper viewport handling for notched devices, no rubber-banding
- **Responsive layout** — sidebars auto-collapse on mobile, restore on desktop. Toolbar scrolls horizontally with fade hints
- **All pages** — Chat, Kanban, Schedule, Auth — every screen adapts to narrow viewports

You're on a train, your tunnel is running, you open the URL on your phone. Full Kanban board with snap-scrolling columns. Full chat with streaming. Full schedule view. Not a "mobile version" — the real thing, optimized for touch.

### 💾 Everything is saved

Sessions, chats, task history — all stored locally in SQLite. Come back tomorrow, continue exactly where you left off.

## Who is it for?

**Individual developers** — manage multiple projects, queue tasks, resume sessions days later without losing context. Schedule nightly test runs and code quality checks. Let Claude work the night shift.

**Teams** — shared Claude Code Studio instance with project visibility, Kanban showing who's doing what, and session history as an audit trail. Set up recurring Monday reviews that scan the week's commits automatically.

**System administrators** — manage your server fleet from one browser tab. Schedule hourly health checks, daily log cleanup, weekly security scans. Delegate complex operations ("update nginx on all 5 servers, verify each one, rollback if tests fail") and get Telegram alerts when they finish. This is your operations platform, not just a chat.

**ML / AI engineers** — run Claude on powerful remote GPU servers via SSH. Queue training jobs and preprocessing tasks. Schedule recurring data pipeline runs. Check results from your phone via Telegram.

---

## What this is (and isn't)

- **Not a SaaS** — runs on your machine, your data never leaves. No account, no telemetry, no vendor lock-in.
- **Not an IDE replacement** — it manages Claude sessions. Keep using VS Code, Cursor, or whatever you prefer.
- **Not a Claude Code fork** — it wraps the official CLI. When Anthropic ships improvements, you get them automatically.

This is infrastructure you own. MIT licensed, no strings.

## Using OpenRouter models

Want to use GPT-4o, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, or any other model available on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) — instead of (or alongside) Anthropic's own models?

Use **[Claude Flow](https://github.com/Lexus2016/claude-flow)** — a companion project that configures Claude Code CLI to route requests through OpenRouter. Set it up once before launching Claude Code Studio, and any model available on OpenRouter becomes usable in Studio's chat, Kanban tasks, and Scheduler.

```bash
# 1. Set up Claude Flow (one-time)
npx github:Lexus2016/claude-flow

# 2. Launch Studio as usual
npx github:Lexus2016/claude-code-studio
```

After setup, Claude Code CLI will use your OpenRouter API key and the model you selected. Studio inherits these settings automatically — no additional configuration needed.
